<h1>HR Attrition Analysis - Power BI Dashboard </h1>
This HR Attrition Dashboard project is developed using the HR Attrition Dataset from Kaggle, which provides employee-related data such as demographics, performance ratings, and satisfaction levels. The dashboard is built in Microsoft Power BI (Version: 2.138.1452.0, 64-bit), a powerful data visualization and business intelligence tool. Power BI was leveraged to create dynamic visualizations, slicers, tooltips, and measures, enabling users to interact with and explore the data.
<h2>Problem Statement : </h2>
Employee attrition is one of organizations' most significant challenges, impacting operational efficiency, employee morale, and financial performance. Understanding the root causes of attrition, identifying high-risk groups, and predicting trends is critical for Human Resources (HR) teams to manage workforce stability proactively. However, organizations often lack a view of attrition metrics and insights, limiting their ability to implement effective retention strategies.

This project aims to develop an interactive **HR Attrition Dashboard** that provides actionable insights into workforce attrition trends, employee satisfaction, and risk factors. By leveraging data visualizations, and key performance indicators (KPIs), the dashboard will enable HR professionals to monitor, analyze, and address attrition effectively.

<h2>Most Important KPIs : </h2>

The HR Attrition Dashboard includes several critical KPIs to provide actionable insights into workforce dynamics. Key metrics include the total number of employees, attrition rate, and current employees, helping HR teams monitor workforce stability. Additionally, the dashboard tracks average employee age and attrition by demographics, such as gender, age group, education level, and department, enabling granular analysis of trends.

It also highlights attrition by job role and education field, providing insights into which areas face the highest turnover. Satisfaction levels are analyzed through average environment satisfaction and job satisfaction, segmented by gender and role, to understand factors influencing employee engagement. The dashboard also incorporates performance ratings, comparing current employees with those who have left, offering a view of how performance correlates with attrition. These KPIs collectively empower HR professionals to identify high-risk areas, develop targeted retention strategies, and improve employee satisfaction to drive organizational success.

<h2>Overview on Dashboards : </h2>

Our project is composed of two dashboard pages.

**On the first page,** we visualized key insights into the potential drivers of attrition. By leveraging donut charts and stacked bar charts, we observed that male employees have slightly higher attrition rates than females. New joiners and employees with less than three years in the company show the highest attrition rates, indicating that early tenure is a critical period for retention. Additionally, the youngest employees, particularly those under 25, exhibit the highest attrition rates.

A clear correlation between monthly income and attrition is evident, with lower-income employees being more prone to leaving. Among departments, the R&D department has the highest attrition level, followed by the sales department. Specific job roles with notable attrition include sales representatives, female human resources professionals, and male laboratory technicians, highlighting areas that may require targeted interventions. This page provides actionable insights to help HR teams focus on key areas for improving retention strategies.

**On the second page of the dashboard**, we further explore drivers of attrition through a focus on education, satisfaction levels, and performance ratings. The Attrition by Education Field visual highlights that employees in Life Sciences and Medical fields exhibit the highest attrition levels, followed by Marketing. Moreover, the education level distribution shows that attrition is most prevalent among employees with a Bachelor's Degree, accounting for 42% of the total attrition, while those with higher education levels, such as Doctoral Degrees, have the lowest rates.

The satisfaction levels analysis, categorized by job role and gender, reveals that lower satisfaction is linked to higher attrition. The average environment satisfaction is 2.72, and job satisfaction is 2.73, indicating room for improvement across these metrics. Alternating between environmental satisfaction levels and job satisfaction levels was done by leveraging the field 

Finally, the performance ratings by gender and job role underscore performance differences between current and ex-employees. While performance ratings tend to decrease for roles experiencing high attrition, such as sales representatives and laboratory technicians, they remain steady in less-affected roles. The breakdown by gender demonstrates slight variations, with male employees showing a slightly higher attrition rate (17.01%) than females (14.80%). This page provides deeper insights for HR teams to align retention strategies with employee education, satisfaction, and performance outcomes.
